# 🎮 2048 Game — HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript

This project is a fully playable **2048 puzzle game** built for the browser using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**. The game supports both **keyboard controls on desktop** and **swipe gestures on mobile devices**.

---

## 🧠 How the Game Works

- The game board is a **4×4 grid** represented internally with a 2D JavaScript array.
- Players move tiles using:
  - ⬅ ➡ ⬆ ⬇ **Arrow keys** (Desktop)
  - 👉👆👈👇 **Swipe gestures** (Mobile / Touch Screens)
- When two tiles with the **same number collide**, they **merge into one** with double the value.
- A new tile (`2`) is spawned into a random empty position after every move.
- The goal is to create a tile with the value **2048**.
- The game automatically detects **Game Over** when no moves are left.
